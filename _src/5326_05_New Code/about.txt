About ChilliGuru
I'm an ex-chef in my early thirties from Birmingham, UK. I hung up my whites three years ago to embark on a career break. I spent 12 months travelling around the Indian subcontinent and South-East Asia. I have always loved cooking with chillies but my passion was taken to another level during a stay in a Yoga school. The Yogi was another chilli enthusiast and imparted to me much of his knowledge about traditional Indian cooking - he was a real inspiration to me.

When I returned to the UK, I decided to re-focus my career on writing and speaking about all things ‘chilli’. I am seriously committed to sharing my knowledge and passion for chillies.

"What this guy doesn't know about chillies, isn't worth knowing!" - T. DuBois, Celebrity Chef 

I am the author of two books about cooking with chillies and make regular appearances at food festivals and on TV cookery shows.
